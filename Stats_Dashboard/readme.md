# Statistical Inference Dashboard

An interactive web dashboard built with Streamlit and Plotly for conducting statistical inference tasks including A/B testing simulation, power analysis calculation, and distribution visualization.

## Features

### A/B Testing Simulation:

Simulate A/B tests with user-specified sample sizes, means or conversion rates. Calculate test statistics (t-test or z-test) and visualize sample distributions or conversion rates interactively.

### Power Analysis Calculator:

Calculate the missing parameter among effect size, significance level (alpha), power, and sample size for two-sample t-tests. Visualize power curves showing power versus sample size.

### Distribution Visualization:

Visualize and overlay probability distributions (Normal, t-distribution, Chi-square) with user-controlled parameters to explore their shapes and characteristics.
